	abstract = {Abstract The convergence behavior of the M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset (MP) perturbation series is investigated utilizing MP correlation energies up to order 65 calculated at the full CI (FCI) level. Fast or slow convergence, initial oscillations, or divergence of the MPn series depend on the electronic system investigated and the basis set used for the FCI calculation. Initial oscillations in the MPn series are observed for systems with electron clustering due to the fact that MP theory exaggerates electron-correlation effects at even orders and corrects this at odd orders. In such cases, it is important that the s,‚Äâp basis is first saturated before diffuse functions are added. With a VDZ+diff basis, too much weight is given to high-order correlation effects described by pentuple and higher excitations, which leads to the formation of artificial intruder states and to the divergence of the MPn series. This can be corrected by extending to VQZ or VPZ basis sets before one adds diffuse functions. Alternatively, one can use m-order Feenberg scaling to exclude backdoor intruder states from the convergence region of the MPn series. For all cases considered, divergence of the MPn series caused by unbalanced basis sets including diffuse functions can be suppressed by Feenberg scaling. Also, initial oscillations of the MPn series can be dampened and convergence acceleration of the MPn series achieved if the appropriate order of Feenberg scaling is determined for the problem in question. The relationship between electronic structure, basis set, and convergence of the MPn series is discussed.‚ÄÉ¬© 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 76: 306‚Äì330, 2000},

	abstract = {The hydrogen phase diagram has several unusual features which are well reproduced by density functional calculations. Unfortunately, these calculations do not provide good physical insights into why those features occur. Here, we present a fast interatomic potential, which reproduces the molecular hydrogen phases: orientationally disordered Phase I; broken-symmetry Phase II and reentrant melt curve. The H 2 vibrational frequency drops at high pressure because of increased coupling between neighbouring molecules, not bond weakening. Liquid H 2 is denser than coexisting close-packed solid at high pressure because the favored molecular orientation switches from quadrupole-energy-minimizing to steric-repulsion-minimizing. The latter allows molecules to get closer together, without the atoms getting closer, but cannot be achieved within in a close-packed layer due to frustration. A similar effect causes negative thermal expansion. At high pressure, rotation is hindered in Phase I, such that it cannot be regarded as a molecular rotor phase.},

	abstract = {Combustion is a complex chemical system which involves thousands of chemical reactions and generates hundreds of molecular species and radicals during the process. In this work, a neural network-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized. Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory experiments could accomplish.},

	abstract = {The study of chemical reactions in aqueous media is very important for its implications in several fields of science, from biology to industrial processes. Modelling these reactions is however difficult when water directly participates in the reaction. Since it requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the system, {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}ab-initio{\}}{\$} molecular dynamics is the ideal candidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a high computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics simulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set of quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is difficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition state configurations. In this study, we used an active learning procedure accelerated by enhanced sampling to harvest such structures and to build a neural-network potential to study the urea decomposition process in water. This allowed us to obtain the free energy profiles of this important reaction in a wide range of temperatures, to discover a number of novel metastable states and to improve the accuracy of the kinetic rates calculations. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the zwitterionic intermediate has the same probability of occurring via an acidic or a basic pathway, which could be the cause of the insensitivity of reaction rates to the pH solution.},

A tool for the automated assembly, molecular optimization and property calculation of supramolecular materials is presented. stk is a modular, extensible and open-source Python library that provides a simple Python API and integration with third party computational codes. stk currently supports the construction of linear polymers, small linear oligomers, organic cages in multiple topologies and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in multiple framework topologies, but is designed to be easy to extend to new, unrelated, supramolecules or new topologies. Extension to metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (MOFs), metallocycles or supramolecules, such as catenanes, would be straightforward. Through integration with third party codes, stk offers the user the opportunity to explore the potential energy landscape of the assembled supramolecule and then calculate the supramolecule's structural features and properties. stk provides support for high-throughput screening of large batches of supramolecules at a time. The source code of the program can be found at https://github.com/supramolecular-toolkit/stk. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of nanoporous materials with highly tunable structures in terms of both chemical composition and topology. Due to their tunable nature, high‚Äêthroughput computational screening is a particularly appealing method to reduce the time‚Äêto‚Äêdiscovery of MOFs with desirable physical and chemical properties. In this work, a fully automated, high‚Äêthroughput periodic density functional theory (DFT) workflow for screening promising MOF candidates was developed and benchmarked, with a specific focus on applications in catalysis. As a proof‚Äêof‚Äêconcept, we use the high‚Äêthroughput workflow to screen MOFs containing open metal sites (OMSs) from the Computation‚ÄêReady, Experimental MOF database for the oxidative C‚ÄîH bond activation of methane. The results from the screening process suggest that, despite the strong C‚ÄîH bond strength of methane, the main challenge from a screening standpoint is the identification of MOFs with OMSs that can be readily oxidized at moderate reaction conditions.},

@article{Persson2010,
	abstract = {The hydration reaction is defined as the transfer of an ion or neutral chemical species from the gaseous phase into water, M n + (g) ‚Üí M n + (aq). In this process, water molecules bind to metal ions through ion-dipole bonds of mainly electrostatic character. The hydration reaction is always strongly exothermic with increasing heat of hydration with increasing charge density of the ion. The structures of the hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution display a variety of configurations depending on the size and electronic properties of the metal ion. The basic configurations of hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution are tetrahedral, octahedral, square antiprismatic, and tricapped trigonal prismatic. This paper gives an overview of the structures of hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution with special emphasis on those with a non-regular coordination figure. Metal ions without d-electrons in the valance shell form regular aqua complexes with a coordination figure, allowing a maximum number of water molecules to be clustered around the metal ion. This number is dependent on the ratio of the metal ion radius to the atomic radius of oxygen in a coordinated water molecule (1.34 {\AA}). The lighter lanthanoid(III) ions have a regular tricapped trigonal prismatic configuration with the M‚ÄìO distance to the capping water molecules somewhat longer than to the prismatic ones. However, with increasing atomic number of the lanthanoid(III) ions, an increasing distortion of the capping water molecules is observed, resulting in a partial loss of water molecules in the capping positions for the heaviest lanthanoids. Metal ions with d 4 and d 9 valance shell electron configuration, as chromium(II) and copper(II), respectively, have Jahn‚ÄìTeller distorted aqua complexes. Metal ions with low charge and ability to form strong covalent bonds, as silver(I), mercury(II), palladium(II), and platinum(II), often display distorted coordination figures due to the second-order Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect. Metal ions with d 10 s 2 valence shell electron configuration may have a stereochemically active lone electron pair (hemi-directed complexes) or an inactive one (holo-directed). The hydrated tin(II), lead(II), and thallium(I) ions are hemi-directed in aqueous solution, while the hydrated bismuth(III) ion is holo-directed. The structures of the hydrated cationic oxo-metal ions are reported as well.},

The complex and time-consuming calculations in molecular simulations are particularly suitable for an ML revolution and have already been profoundly affected by the application of existing ML methods. Here we review recent ML methods for molecular simulation, with particular focus on (deep) neural networks for the prediction of quantum-mechanical energies and forces, on coarse-grained molecular dynamics, on the extraction of free energy surfaces and kinetics, and on generative network approaches to sample molecular equilibrium structures and compute thermodynamics. To explain these methods and illustrate open methodological problems, we review some important principles of molecular physics and describe how they can be incorporated into ML structures. Finally, we identify and describe a list of open challenges for the interface between ML and molecular simulation.},

	abstract = {Whereas the interactions between water molecules are dominated by strongly directional hydrogen bonds (HBs), it was recently proposed that relatively weak, isotropic van der Waals (vdW) forces are essential for understanding the properties of liquid water and ice. This insight was derived from ab initio computer simulations, which provide an unbiased description of water at the atomic level and yield information on the underlying molecular forces. However, the high computational cost of such simulations prevents the systematic investigation of the influence of vdW forces on the thermodynamic anomalies of water. Here, we develop efficient ab initio-quality neural network potentials and use them to demonstrate that vdW interactions are crucial for the formation of water's density maximum and its negative volume of melting. Both phenomena can be explained by the flexibility of the HB network, which is the result of a delicate balance of weak vdW forces, causing, e.g., a pronounced expansion of the second solvation shell upon cooling that induces the density maximum.},

@article{Kovacs2021,
	abstract = {Organic synthesis remains a major challenge in drug discovery. Although a plethora of machine learning models have been proposed as solutions in the literature, they suffer from being opaque black-boxes. It is neither clear if the models are making correct predictions because they inferred the salient chemistry, nor is it clear which training data they are relying on to reach a prediction. This opaqueness hinders both model developers and users. In this paper, we quantitatively interpret the Molecular Transformer, the state-of-the-art model for reaction prediction. We develop a framework to attribute predicted reaction outcomes both to specific parts of reactants, and to reactions in the training set. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to retrieve evidence for predicted reaction outcomes, and understand counterintuitive predictions by scrutinising the data. Additionally, we identify Clever Hans predictions where the correct prediction is reached for the wrong reason due to dataset bias. We present a new debiased dataset that provides a more realistic assessment of model performance, which we propose as the new standard benchmark for comparing reaction prediction models.},

	abstract = {Elemental phosphorus is attracting growing interest across fundamental and applied fields of research. However, atomistic simulations of phosphorus have remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we show that a universally applicable force field for phosphorus can be created by machine learning (ML) from a suitably chosen ensemble of quantum-mechanical results. Our model is fitted to density-functional theory plus many-body dispersion (DFT + MBD) data; its accuracy is demonstrated for the exfoliation of black and violet phosphorus (yielding monolayers of ‚Äúphosphorene‚Äù and ‚Äúhittorfene‚Äù); its transferability is shown for the transition between the molecular and network liquid phases. An application to a phosphorene nanoribbon on an experimentally relevant length scale exemplifies the power of accurate and flexible ML-driven force fields for next-generation materials modelling. The methodology promises new insights into phosphorus as well as other structurally complex, e.g., layered solids that are relevant in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science.},

This is made possible by combining advanced free-energy methods and state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques. The ab initio description leads to structural properties in excellent agreement with experiments and reliable estimates of the melting points of light and heavy water. We observe that nuclear-quantum effects contribute a crucial 0.2 m e V / H 2 O to the stability of ice Ih, making it more stable than ice Ic. Our computational approach is general and transferable, providing a comprehensive framework for quantitative predictions of ab initio thermodynamic properties using machine-learning potentials as an intermediate step.},

@article{Cawley2010,
	abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds. {\textcopyright} 2010 Gavin C.
